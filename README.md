I have created a bar chart to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable "Sex Ratio" in the Indian population for 2001 and 2011. Here I have compared the sex ratio of all the states and union territories of India in the year 2001 and 2011. I have used MS Excel software for the data visualization.
